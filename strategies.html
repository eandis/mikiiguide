                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>There is a lot of differents strategies for Mikii, both for ARS and SRS. I will not be covering them
                    all, but i will talk about the ones i
                    personally think are the most viable ways to beat the game. You can see most (if not all) strategies
                    to beat
                    Mikii on Greentea's
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmyMb-hnf4h_YKkQEPjpNlBg2JqBVYZAD">channel.</a>
                </p>

                <p>Strategies vary a lot based on difficulty, speed, medals required. Depending on whether
                    you just want to get a 1300-2600 run, get GM, or aim for high GM-Rounds grades,
                    you might want to choose one strategy over another.
                </p>
                <p>I will showcase all of the strategies I think are worth learning the most.</p>

                <h2><a href="yoshi.html">Combo funnel (Yoshi100_Aus' strat)</a></h2>

                <p>The strategy was made by Yoshi100_Aus. It focuses on burning pieces in a widening funnel,
                    starting from a 1 wide,
                    slowly transitioning into a 4 wide. It is a variation of what people
                    call a "tower" strat.</p>

                            <h3>Pros</h3>
                            <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;">
                                <li>- Can achieve very fast times.</li>
                                <li>- Many, many ways to get rid of residue in the well.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <div style="flex: 1;">
                            <h3>Cons</h3>
                            <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;">
                                <li>- Requires a good amount of medals.</li>
                                <li>- Hard to learn.</li>
                                <li>- You do not gain medals during execution, making END GAME harder.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>In my opinion this is <i>the</i> best strategy up to date, if you want to get the highest grades
                    possible.
                    Might be a bit overkill to learn if you just want to get a 2600 run though.

                <h2><a href="greentea.html">1-2-3 wide (Greentea's strat)</a></h2>
                <p>Another "tower" strat. This one was made by Greentea and involves starting with a tetris well,
                    transitioning into a 2x2 box,
                    allowing to score tetrises while silmultaneously
                    burning pieces on the side.</p>

                            <li>- Easier to learn than combo funnel.</li>
                            <li>- No need for as many medals as combo funnel</li>
                            <li>- Gains medals during execution which makes END GAME easier.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div style="flex: 1;">
                        <h3>Cons</h3>
                        <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;">
                            <li>- Slower than combo funnel.</li>
                            <li>- Quite a bit of piece sequences are unsolvable</li>

                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>This is the strat you'd probably want to go with if you want to get your first GM, as
                you don't have to learn as many setups as combo funnel.
                Could also be used as a backup
                strategy to the combo funnel strat
                if your transition into 1300 is messy.
            <h2><a href="lineout.html">Freestyle/Korean/Line-out</a></h2>

            <p>A lot of different names for that one. But the core concept is the following: burn lines as <b>fast as
                    possible</b>. That's it. You just have to outpace the ice. </p>

                        <h3>Pros</h3>
                        <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;">
                            <li>- You don't have to learn any setups.</li>
                            <li>- Looks cool.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div style="flex: 1;">
                        <h3>Cons</h3>
                        <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;">
                            <li>- Extremely hard.</li>
                            <li>- Extremely slow.</li>
                            <li>- Requires an insane amount of medals.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Probably the first strat that comes to mind when you try Mikii for the first time. Requires a crazy
                amount of skill and medals to pull off
                in return of... being slower and getting lower GM-Rounds grades. You might not even make the 2600 torikan with this strat. I still
                recommend to try it out though,
                helps out a lot with mastering Cyclone. And it's fun!</p>

            <h2><a href="hybrid.html">Hybrid (Freestyle+Tetris)</a></h2>
            <p>The name speaks for itself. You build a regular tetris well, but you do freestyle stacking on top of it,
                trying to maintain height while scoring tetrises
                when possible.</p>

                            <li>- More forgiving than pure freestyle.</li>

                            <li>- Harder than tower strats.</li>

                </div>

            <p>The closest you will get to regular Tetris - a realistic alternative to pure freestyle. Doesn't present
                much value though, in my opinion.
                Harder than tower strats without being as fast. </p>
